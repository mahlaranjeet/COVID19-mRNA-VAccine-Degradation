# Project Name
> COVID19 mRNA vaccine degradation data sets


## Table of Contents
* [General Info](#base model)
* [Technologies Used](#constrained model)
* [Conclusions](#unconstrained model)
* [Acknowledgements](#reactivity mRNA degradation)

<!-- You can include any other section that is pertinent to your problem -->

## General Information.
- the project is about mRNA stability estimation?
- the project is about base model, constrained model and unconstrained model for mRNA vaccine stability?
- the used data is sourced from kaggle COVID19 vaccine test and train model and abzu ai?

<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Conclusions
- People who have bad loan grade are more likely to default
- people who have public record of bank reputcy are more likely to default
- low income is a driving factor of loan default
- majority of loan are good loans 
- debt to income ratio when it is high loan default can hppen
